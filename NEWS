Changes in Version 0.2.5

  o added the S3 method logLik.pers to extract the Log-Likelihood for object of class "pers"

  o added the function rfa() and its plotting and summary S3 method to perfom rasch residual factor analysis proposed by Wright (1996) and further discussed by Linacre (1998).

  o added the function iff() to plot or return values for Item Information Function.

  o added the function tff() to plot or return values for Test Information Function.

  o added two example dataset (kft5 and Neoffi) used in Rost (2004).

  o added an optional argument in function pers() for calculation of the WLE reliability.

  o changed spliting argument in function grm() and changed S3 methods plot and summary for objects of class "grm"

  o fixed a minor bug in S3 method plot.grm when defining axis annotation 

  o fixed a error messages which occured under extreme sparse data situations using function pers()

Changes in Version 0.2.4

  o fixed a mismatch when calcualting item and person fit statistic under booklet design circumstances
  o fixed some error messages which occur under extreme sparse data situations in some internal functions.
  o added WLE Reliability in object of class "pers".

  o changed summary method for object of class "pers".

  o added plotting method for object of class "pers" and documentation. This plots a person item map. 

Changes in Version 0.2.2

  o added main function pair() for item parameter calculation for dicho- or polytomuous data . Data with unequal number of categories for items can be processed. 

  o added main function pers() for person parameter (WLE) calculation for dicho- or polytomuous data. Data with unequal number of categories for items can be processed. 

  o added function ptbis() for calculation of point biserial correlations for dicho- or polytomous item categories with total scale.

  o added person - pairwise.person.fit() - and item - pairwise.item.fit() - fit indices. 

  o added function for tabulation of response data - ftab(). 

  o added function for expected score curves plots - esc().

  o added function for category probability plots - catprob(). 

  o added function for graphical item fit by empirical category probability plots - gif().

  o added another (small) example dataset sim200x3, containing simulated Data with one dichotomous and two polytoumous items with 200 observations.

  o added a (large) example data structure DEU_PISA2012 - for a detailed description of the data structure see the section User guides, package vignettes and other documentation.

  o changed the plotting methods for "pair"", "grm" and "pairSE" and added documentation for them.

  o removed deprecated functions (from version 0.1.5): 
itempar.dicho(), itempar.poly(), grmSE.dicho(), grmSE.poly(), ipSE.dicho(), ipSE.poly(), ppML.dicho(), ppWL.dicho(), thetaML.dicho(), thetaWL.dicho, ptbis.dicho(). 
Those functions are therefore only available in older version of pairwise in the CRAN archive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 0.1.5

  o added function for Point Biserial Correlations ptbis.dicho() (dicotoumous items)

  o added function for handling booklet designs make.incidenz()

  o added functions for person parameter estimation (ML & WL) and summary method (dicotoumous items)

  o added summary method for graphical model-check dichotomuos (object of class 'grmSE')

  o added summary method for graphical model-check polytomuos (object of class 'grmSEpo')


Changes in Version 0.1.4

  o added the argument zerocor in the functions for parameter calculations - see descriptions of functions

  o changed some matrix calculations to enhance processing speed (due to a tip from Alexander Robitzsch)
