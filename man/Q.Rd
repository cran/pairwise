\title{Person Fit Index Q}
\usage{
Q(obj = NULL, data = NULL, threshold = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{an object of class \code{"pers"} or class \code{"pair"}as a result from function \code{\link{pers}} or \code{\link{pair}} respectively.}

\item{data}{optional response data when object of class \code{"pers"} or class \code{"pair"} is not provided.}

\item{threshold}{optional in case that object of class \code{"pers"} or class \code{"pair"} is not provided. Threshold values as matrix with row and columnnames !! -- items as rows and thresholds as columns. Thresholds should be ordered from left to right, some items may have less thresholds than the others, in this case the respective row/column is filled with an NA value - see examples.}

\item{...}{not used so far.}
}
\value{
a vector holding the Q-index for every person.
}
\description{
function for calculating the person fit index Q, which was proposed by Tarnai and Rost (1990).
}
\details{
The person Q-index proposed by Tarnai and Rost, (1990) is solely based on the empirical responses and the item parameters. Thus the computation of person parameters using the function \code{\link{pers}} is not required - see examples. But for convenience return objects of both functions are accepted in function \code{Q}.
